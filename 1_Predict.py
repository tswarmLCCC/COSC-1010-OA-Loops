Task:
Read the code below. Without running it, what do you think the output will be?
Write down your prediction and a short reason for it.

Think about these questions:
- What does the range(5) function do?
- What numbers will the variable 'i' hold?
- How many times will the print statement run?

Predict Activity 2: Countdown

Task:
Look at this 'while' loop. What will it print to the screen?
Write down what you think the final output will be.

Think about these questions:
- What is the starting value of 'counter'?
- What condition is the 'while' loop checking?
- What happens to the value of 'counter' inside the loop?
- When will the loop stop?
